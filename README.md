<p>
  osTicket, like most ticketing systems, depend on a hierarchy in order to correctly deliver the ticket depending on how urgent and dificult a task is. For this reason we need to create and assign the correct roles.<br>
  To begin, we need to first access to osTicket using the user we designated as our Admin. Once inside, we'll need to go to the Admin Panel in order to make changes.
